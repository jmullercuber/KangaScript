Mostly working interpreter!
A lota stuff over past few days since last commit
Execution script: ksexec.py, so KangaScript can be run from command line (readme shall be updated to show this)
A few test scripts
Few things not fully functional in interpreter:
	Assigning to Dotted identifiers
	Import statement
	=! operator
	Error handleing (actually don't even have tokens for it)
	Interpreter is weak about throwing errors

	Functions inside functions (it generally works, but not absolutely. If the functions/parameters/arguments have the same name, that's when you have a problem. See strange error in KangaScript/test2.ks)

Operator precedence works! (an important change to the parser necessary around binary operators. didn't know)

Custom datatypes

TODO:
	I want an operator matrix, or something (if that even makes sence) to handle combining datatypes with operators. Currently, defaults to python representation.
